# Gaming-Dependency-Pack

Contains all common redistributable packs for VC, .Net, and DX. 
Installs all clean and quick with self-elevating batch file.

Also opts out of .Net telemetry using the documented envar.


Created because I wanted games and apps to work right after reinstalling.
Open an issue if you have a request for other deps like XAML 2.X etc.
